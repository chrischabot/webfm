WebFM 1.0

    To configure this file manager for all virtual hosts
    and hide the script from the virual host's document root
    place fm.php in a dir outside of the document root
    For example /var/www/fm.php, and the images in /var/www/fmicons
    then configure Apache aliases to access them as such:
    	Alias /filemanager "/var/www/fm.php"
    	Alias /fmicons/ "/var/www/fmicons/"
    then you can use the file manager on any virtual host thru:
    	http://localhost/filemanager
